# Translation of Vimeup

Code has been added to strings in Vimeup that will need to be translated to have the user interface in another language. After adding new string to the code the following command can be run to update the vimeup.pot file that can be used to create new translations from or update existing translations.

``` bash
pybabel extract --keywords=t ./vimeup.py -o locale/vimeup.pot
```
The coder has decided to name the translation function `t()` instead of the Python default translation function of `_()`. This is why there is the `--keywords=t` part in the command above. The default translation function can also be used, but I think that `t()` for translation is clearer as to what it does.

[Poedit](https://poedit.net/) can be downloaded for Windows, MacOS and Linux to translate the `.po` files for a new or existing translation. It can also be used to update the translation strings from either the `.pot` file or directly from the source code of `vimeup.py`.
